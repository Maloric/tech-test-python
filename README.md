# About

The goal of this repo is to test the developer's basic knowledge of Python, problem solving and testing.

Open ./user_service.py and implement the get_users_with_popular_posts function such that:

-   it returns users from the provided DataService as an array
-   ensure that each user has a "posts" field that contains all posts by that user
-   the list of users should only include those who have written a "popular" post (any single post with 10 or more comments)

## Stretch goal

Implement unit tests for the get_users_with_popular_posts method.
